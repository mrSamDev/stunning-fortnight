Pre requisites

How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?
    > React, test mandates using react
    > Material UI , One of the most used and feature rich theme solutions available to quickly build ui with everyless css
    > React-Hook-forms , Form handling is one of the biggest drawback of react , react-hook-form package make it relatively simple with feature react api package and documentation

Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
    > Add history to see the previous url
    > More Options/ preset options in content type,
    > Change style and feel to much warmer tone
    > Would have found a better Api response timing calculator

What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
    > Would have used custom css to build instead of material ui
    > Updated the style and colors a little bit more
    > History
    > Option to get code like in postmon
    >
